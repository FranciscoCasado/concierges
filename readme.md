# Concierges Boardgame

A boardgame where concierges try to finish the day, while residents demand the most ludicrous orders and the building must be maintained in proper shape. * Currently under development

This repo is mainly for simulation and balancing purposes. The real game is intended to be a physical boardgame, some picture of the prototype soon :)
